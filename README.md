# README

This is a Ruby on Rails application which uses RabbitMQ, JavaScript, and a few
3rd party APIs to create data dashboards which report iOS app marketplace 
activity. Its an excuse for me to demonstrate software design and 
testing around external facing modules, and that Ruby absolutely can 
participate in the domains of distributed systems and data engineering.

🚧 This application is currently under construction. 🏗
